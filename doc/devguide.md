# ANAFI Parrot Developer Guide

## Introduction

This guide was created for me to keep track of what i learned when learning how to develop sofware for the [ANAFI Ai 4G robotic UAV](https://www.parrot.com/us/drones/anafi-ai) (drone) which is developed by the french drone company Parrot. There are multiple SDKs in the ecosystem that surrounds the sofware off this drone, which is why it can be helpful to keep track of everything.

Disclaimer! I am a computer science student, and not a proffesional developer, do not use this tutorial as a root of trust etc, this hasnt been properly tested.

## Overview

This is an overview of the organization, the drone, and its software development kit (SDK).

* [Parrot](https://www.parrot.com/us) - This is the company that develops the ANAFI AI UAV, they also develop and maintain software for it?.

* [ANAFI Ai - The 4G robotic UAV](https://www.parrot.com/us/drones/anafi-ai) - This is one of the drones developed by parrot which is the first drone that can be controlled over the 4G network (this is the drone model I will refer to when i say drone).

* [Parrot SDK](https://developer.parrot.com/) - Parrot website for developers which provides an overview of all the platforms and SDKS
    
    * [Sphinx](https://developer.parrot.com/docs/sphinx/) - Documentation for drone simulation using [Unreal Engine 4](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US) for Ubuntu only. Used to develop and test features for drones.
    * [Olympe](https://developer.parrot.com/docs/olympe/overview.html) - A Ground Control Station python framework which allows the drone to be controlled remotely. Can connect to real and simulated drones.
    * [Air SDK](https://developer.parrot.com/docs/airsdk/general/overview.html) - A framework that allows you to load code that runs on the drone. Used to create drone missions.

## Prerequisuites

First you will need to gain access to a username and password. This can be done by emailing the developers at ... You will need to run ubuntu os.

### Installation

* For simulator
* For stuff

## Getting started

## Docker

## Ideas

* Verification script which you can run in order to verify your

Step 1: Verify that you fulfill hardware requirements, drivers are up to date etc.
Step 2: Download everything for you (Dependencies, SDKs)
Step 3: Start up the simulator and run some script to verify it works?
